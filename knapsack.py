# Given weights and values of n items, put these items in

# In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] 
# which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. 
# Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, 
# find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset
#  is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, 
#  either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
